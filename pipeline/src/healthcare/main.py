Healthcare Data Pipeline — main entry point.

Stages:
  1. FETCH   — World Bank API + curated NHP/NFHS data
  2. TRANSFORM — Build output schemas from raw data
  3. VALIDATE — Pydantic model checks
  4. PUBLISH — Write JSON to public/data/healthcare/

Data sources:
  - World Bank Development Indicators (hospital beds, physicians, health spending, immunization, TB/HIV)
  - National Health Profile 2022 — CBHI (state-level infrastructure)
  - NFHS-5 2019-21 (state-level immunization coverage)

Note: This domain focuses on infrastructure + spending + disease burden.
Mortality (IMR, MMR, U5MR) and life expectancy are in the Census domain.
