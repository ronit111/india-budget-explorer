Census & Demographics Data Pipeline — main entry point.

Stages:
  1. FETCH   — World Bank API + curated Census 2011 / NFHS-5 / SRS data
  2. TRANSFORM — Build output schemas from raw data
  3. VALIDATE — Pydantic model checks
  4. PUBLISH — Write JSON to public/data/census/

Data sources:
  - World Bank Development Indicators (population, demographics, health, literacy)
  - Census of India 2011 (state-level population, literacy, sex ratio)
  - NFHS-5 2019-21 (state-level health and nutrition indicators)
  - SRS 2022 (state-level infant mortality rates)
