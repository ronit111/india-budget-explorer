# Indian Data Project

Open Indian government data made accessible, visual, and shareable. Ten data domains live: Union Budget 2025-26, Economic Survey 2025-26, RBI Data, State Finances, Census & Demographics, Education, Employment, Healthcare, Environment, and Elections. Each gets its own visual story with explorable breakdowns. Three personalization calculators let citizens see how national data applies to their own lives.

## Design System

See [BRAND.md](./BRAND.md) for the full visual identity guide. Key principles:

- **Data IS the design** — visualizations paint directly onto the background, no card wrappers
- **Restrained craft** — numbered narrative sections, scroll-triggered word reveals, generous whitespace
- **IIB-inspired palettes** — 2-3 intentional colors per composition, not 12 random chart colors
- **Dark cinematic theme** — deep navy-black (`#06080f`) with saffron (`#FF6B35`), gold (`#FFC857`), and cyan (`#4AEADC`) accents

---

## SEO & Discoverability

The site is built for maximum discoverability:

- **Prerendered HTML** for all 55 routes (45 pages + 10 embed routes, Puppeteer at build time)
- **JSON-LD** structured data: `WebApplication`, `Dataset` x10 (Budget + Economy + RBI + States + Census + Education + Employment + Healthcare + Environment + Elections for Google Dataset Search), `BreadcrumbList`
- **Per-route meta tags** via react-helmet-async (title, description, OG image, Twitter card, canonical)
- **sitemap.xml** covering 55 pages + 54 downloadable data endpoints
- **robots.txt** explicitly welcoming AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended)
- **llms.txt** for AI model discoverability (all 10 domains + glossary terms + embed API)
- **Noscript fallback** with real content across all ten domains for crawlers that don't execute JS
- **Embeddable charts** via `/embed/{domain}/{section}` — standalone responsive iframes for journalists and bloggers

---
