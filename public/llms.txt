# Indian Data Project

> Open Indian government data made accessible, visual, and shareable. Dense PDFs and buried spreadsheets turned into interactive visual stories.

## What this site does

Indian Data Project is a hub for Indian government data visualization. Each data domain (budget, economic survey, RBI data, state finances, census & demographics) gets its own visual story with explorable breakdowns. Five domains are live: Union Budget 2025-26, Economic Survey 2025-26, RBI Data, State Finances, and Census & Demographics.
