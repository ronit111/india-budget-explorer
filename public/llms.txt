# Indian Data Project

> Open Indian government data made accessible, visual, and shareable. Dense PDFs and buried spreadsheets turned into interactive visual stories.

## What this site does

Indian Data Project is a hub for Indian government data visualization. Each data domain (budget, economic survey, RBI data, state finances) gets its own visual story with explorable breakdowns. Four domains are live: Union Budget 2025-26, Economic Survey 2025-26, RBI Data, and State Finances.
